Will you be the Laila to my Majnu?
That saree looks very nice on you. It would look even better off of you
If I were a dhol I'd let you bang me all night long
Twinkle twinkle little star, you should come back to my ghar ;)
Are you a jilebi cause there's nothing sweeter than you
Hey how about we get together and I mix my pani with your puri?
Our parents engaged us when we were little...they must've forgotten to tell you
With me you'll feel like the Ganges..wet, dirty, and constantly moving
You eat a lot of eggplant cause that body is bengan!
If you like bananas come with me cause I'm akela
Baby we go together like daal and bhaat
You are hotter than my amma's chicken curry
Is your butt as round as your roti?
If I could rearrange the alphabet, I wouldn't. The only thing I'd arrange is our marriage.
Hey you're cute, can I get your parent's number?
I'll have my parents call your parents
The day I saw you, I cancelled my shaadi.com account.
Are you a muruku? Cause you belong in my mouth
Won't chapati with me?
I'm addicted to you like an aunty to chai.
Dating me is like being in a rickshaw on a potholed road - one helluva ride!
I'll have my mom send a rishta to yours.
You're so hot, you put the desi in desirable.
Just so you know...I have a Green Card.
You look like you could use some hot chocolate?
Twinkle Twinkel little star, will you be my pehla pyaar?
Girl were you born on Diwali? Cause you're a pataka!
Your butt is rounder than my idlis.
